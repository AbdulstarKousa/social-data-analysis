For each set of plots, describe the plots (as you would in the figure text in a report or paper), and pick a few aspects that stand out to you and comment on those (a couple of ideas below for things that could be interesting to comment on ... but it's OK to chose something else).\n",

[Here's what my version looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2021/master/files/weekdays.png). Hint for comment: Some things make sense - for example `drunkenness` and the weekend. But there are some aspects that were surprising to me. Check out `prostitution` and mid-week behavior, for example!?\n",
    "* *The months*. We can also check if some months are worse by counting up number of crimes in Jan, Feb, ..., Dec. Did you see any surprises there?\n",
    "* *The 24 hour cycle*. We'll can also forget about weekday and simply count up the number of each crime-type that occurs in the entire dataset from midnight to 1am, 1am - 2am ... and so on. Again: Give me a couple of comments on what you see. \n",
    "* *Hours of the week*. But by looking at just 24 hours, we may be missing some important trends that can be modulated by week-day, so let's also check out the 168 hours of the week. So let's see the number of each crime-type Monday night from midninght to 1am, Monday night from 1am-2am - all the way to Sunday night from 11pm to midnight.\n"
